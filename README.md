## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution


The proposed solution is to create a community radio–based agricultural advisory system with expert call-in support, designed especially for small and marginal farmers who lack access to personalized, real-time guidance. Most farmers depend on guesswork, local shopkeepers, or traditional methods, which often result in poor yields and excessive costs. Through this solution, farmers will receive daily radio programs in their local languages, covering essential topics such as crop selection, fertilizer management, pest control, irrigation techniques, and weather-based advisories. The system will also feature a live call-in facility, where farmers can directly interact with agricultural experts and receive solutions tailored to their specific problems. This dual approach—mass communication through broadcasts and personalized interaction via calls—ensures that both general awareness and individual needs are addressed. The use of local dialects and simple explanations overcomes literacy and language barriers, while the participatory format encourages farmers to share their field experiences and indigenous knowledge with the community. Additionally, seasonal special programs can be organized to address pressing issues like drought, pest outbreaks, or government schemes, ensuring timely and relevant information. Workshops, success stories, and expert interviews can be broadcast to inspire adoption of sustainable farming practices. By combining traditional radio with expert-backed advice, the model offers a low-cost, inclusive, and farmer-friendly knowledge network that connects modern agricultural science with grassroots farming practices, ultimately empowering farmers to make informed decisions and improve productivity sustainably.

## Technical Approach
The system would be implemented using low-cost FM transmitters with a 10–15 km coverage radius, supported by a small studio setup with audio equipment and internet connectivity. Content will include pre-recorded advisories, seasonal updates, and success stories, alongside live interactive shows where experts from agricultural universities, Krishi Vigyan Kendras, and NGOs provide direct solutions. Programs will be broadcast in local dialects with simple, practical examples, while farmers themselves will be encouraged to contribute updates, fostering a participatory and relatable knowledge-sharing platform.
## Feasibility and Viability
The model is highly feasible as community radio is already supported under Indian government policies, and the setup requires moderate investment of ₹2–5 lakhs with low operating costs. Since radio receivers are cheap and widely available, adoption will be high even among low-income households. Viability is strengthened by the potential for funding through government schemes, CSR initiatives, and farmer cooperatives. With each station covering multiple villages, the system can be scaled regionally, ensuring long-term sustainability and community ownership.
## Impact and Benefits
The solution will empower farmers with timely, localized, and expert advice, reducing dependence on unreliable sources and guesswork. This leads to better crop yields, reduced input costs, and sustainable farming practices that minimize excessive chemical use. It also fosters collective learning within the farming community and creates a feedback channel for policymakers and extension officers. Overall, the model improves rural livelihoods, encourages environmentally responsible agriculture, and builds farmer confidence in adopting modern practices.
